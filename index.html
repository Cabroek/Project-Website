      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Recent breakthroughs in large language models(LLMs) have led to the
        development of tools like Chat GPT and Bing Chat, which can produce
        texts comparable to those written by competent writers. The affordances
        of these tools encourage users to offload large parts of their thinking
        and writing onto the LLM. But in doing so, users ' surrender autonomy
        and authorship over their writing. Could LLMs instead encourage writers
        to reflect on texts that they wrote themselves? Could these reflections
        lead them to make meaningful revisions to their texts? Our goal is to
        provide writers with a tool that promotes reflection and encourages
        revision of their writing. Many writers encounter challenges such as
        grappling with opposing viewpoints, structuring their documents
        effectively, and seeking inspiration for their writing. To emphasize the
        significance of this problem, it's worth noting that effective writing
        is a critical skill in academia and many professions. A tool that can
        aid writers in overcoming common obstacles can have a profound impact on
        their writing quality and productivity. We want to provide tools that
        help users along and expand on their original thinking and writing,
        rather than take away the need for it entirely.
